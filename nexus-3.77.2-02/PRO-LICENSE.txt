Sonatype shall defend Company against any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding ("Claim") made or brought against Company by a third party alleging that Company’s use of the Products as permitted in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Company for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, Company in connection with any such Claim; provided that Company (i) promptly gives Sonatype written notice of the Claim; (ii) gives Sonatype sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim; and (iii) provides to Sonatype all reasonable assistance, at Sonatype’s expense.  Sonatype shall have no liability under this Agreement with respect to any Claim based upon: (A) combination, modification or use of the Products with equipment, products, systems, software, materials or processes not furnished by Sonatype if, absent such combination or modification, no infringement would exist; (B) use of the Products that breaches this Agreement or that is inconsistent with the Documentation; or (C) use of any version of the Products other than the most current version or failure to timely implement any new release, modification, update, or replacement of the Products made available to Company by Sonatype.

This Section 9(a) states Sonatype’s sole liability to Company, and Company’s exclusive remedy against Sonatype, for any and all Claim(s).

b.	Company Indemnification. Company will defend Sonatype and its Affiliates against any Claim made or brought against Sonatype by a third party alleging that any Company Data or use of Company Data with a Product infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights, or Claim arising from Company’s use of a Product in an unlawful manner or in violation of the Agreement, Documentation, or Ordering Document (each a “Claim Against Sonatype”), and shall indemnify Sonatype for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, Sonatype in connection with any such Claim Against Sonatype provided Sonatype (a) promptly gives Company written notice of the Claim Against Sonatype, (b) gives Company sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Sonatype (except that Company may not settle any Claim Against Sonatype unless it unconditionally releases Sonatype of all liability), and (c) gives Company all reasonable assistance, at Company’s expense.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company will not, directly or indirectly, remove or export from the United States or allow the export, re-export, or transfer (in country) of any part of the Product and/or Documentation: (A) to any jurisdiction that is subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions or any party ordinarily resident in such jurisdiction; (B) to any party identified on (or controlled by one or more parties identified on) any U.S. government restricted party list, including without limitation the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Persons List, Entity List, and Unverified List or U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (C) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (D) otherwise in violation of any export, sanctions import, or other trade restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or applicable foreign governmental authority. In the event any activities contemplated by or undertaken in connection with this Agreement and any other agreements and documents delivered or executed in connection herewith become unlawful under Sanctions Laws or involve any activity sanctionable under Sanctions Laws (a “Sanctions Event”), Sonatype may immediately suspend its performance obligations under this Agreement and upon written notice to Company and/or terminate this Agreement.  Sonatype shall not be liable (for a refund or otherwise) to Company or any other third party with whom Company or any other party may have a contractual obligation related to this Agreement as a result of its suspension and/or termination of the Agreement due to the occurrence of a Sanctions Event. “Sanctions Laws” mean the sanctions laws or regulations administered by the U.S. government (including the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury), the European Union or its member states, Her Majesty’s Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, or any other relevant sanctions authority.

Company hereby agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (including their respective employees, Contractors, agents and representatives) have received or been offered any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Sonatype’s employees or agents in connection with this Agreement. Reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business do not violate the above restriction. If Company learns of any violation of the above restriction, Company will promptly notify Sonatype’s Legal Department at legal@sonatype.com.

f.	Force Majeure. Sonatype shall be excused from performance of its obligations under this Agreement if such a failure to perform results from compliance with any requirement of applicable law or government order, acts of God, pandemic, epidemic, disease, fire, strike, embargo, terrorist attack, war, insurrection or riot, national or regional emergency, internet service provider failure or delay, denial of service or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sonatype.  Any delay resulting from any such cause shall extend performance accordingly or excuse performance, in whole or in part, as may be reasonable under the circumstances.

g.	Waiver and Cumulative Remedies; Severability. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that right. Other than as expressly stated herein, the remedies provided herein are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other remedies of a Party at law or in equity. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

h.	Assignment. Neither Party will have the right to assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that each Party will have the right to assign this Agreement to an Affiliate and, in the case of Sonatype, pursuant to a merger, consolidation, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the business to which this Agreement relates.
